# The Erik Palmgren Archive

This repository aims to collect and host research material of Erik Palmgren (1963–2019).  It is currently maintained by Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine, <p.l.lumsdaine@math.su.se>.

Erik’s own website https://staff.math.su.se/palmgren/ is now mirrored at https://github.com/peterlefanulumsdaine/palmgren-archive (based on this repository), since the original is no longer fully functional due to changes in the department’s web hosting setup.

This repo also includes copies of Erik’s formalisation projects, with the aim of keeping them minimally maintained to remain buildable; and may in future also contaim any other work of Erik’s that he had made available.

Currently, this archive is highly incomplete — I am adding things on an on-demand basis.  If you are interested in any of Erik’s formalisations or writings that are not yet available here, please open an issue or drop the maintainer an email, and I will add them if I have the files available.  If any of his formalisations no longer compile, please open an issue or contribute a pull request to update them.
