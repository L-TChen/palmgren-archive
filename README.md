# The Erik Palmgren Archive

This repository aims to collect and host research material of Erik Palmgren (1963–2019).  It is currently maintained by Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine <p.l.lumsdaine@math.su.se>.

Besides his published papers, Erik had made various other writings and computer formalisations available through his personal website at https://staff.math.su.se/palmgren/.  Re-hosting them here has several aims: primarily, to keep them available in case his personal website becomes inactive in future, and (for the formalisations) to keep them minimally maintained in order to remain usable.

Currently, this archive is highly incomplete — I am adding things on an on-demand basis.  If you are interested in any of Erik’s formalisations or writings that are not yet available here, please open an issue or drop me an email, and I will add them if I have the files available.  If any of his formalisations no longer compile, please open an issue or contribute a pull request to update them.
